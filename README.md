# DFHack Compendium
A collection of DFHack mods, experiments, and reference notes created while exploring and extending Dwarf Fortress through scripting.

***
*Note: I prefer Adventure Mode to Fortress Mode so the mods may need to be modified to work in Fort Mode.*

## Mods
* **Party Add**: Add any NPC to your adventurer party. Needs a little work as some NPCs will leave the party if they're too far from home or if they can't path to the player.
* **Party Remove**: Removes any NPC from your adventurer party.
* **Random Event**: A random event occurs on a set interval. A good way to add chaos to your playthrough. Needs more events though. Events work in both Adventure and Fortress Mode.
  - **Berserk Event**: A random unit will become berserk.
  - **Instant Baby Event**: A random adult male/adult female will instantly have a baby.
  - **Make Unit Vampire Event**: Doesn't work. Its supposed to select a random unit and turn them into a vampire.
  - **Random Pregnancy Event**: A random adult male/adult female will conceive with a default 9 months gestation.
  - **Unit On Fire Event**: A random unit will be set on fire.
* **Random Pregnancy**: Chooses a random adult male and adult female to have a kid. The child is born 9 months later. It is very random as weird couplings can happen. Perhaps a chipmunk man and an elephant woman shouldn't have kids...
